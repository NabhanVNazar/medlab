# Git Basics

- **git init**  
  Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder. This makes Git start tracking files inside that folder.

- **git add**  
  Stages changes (files or updates) so they are ready to be committed. For example, `git add file.txt`.

- **git commit**  
  Saves the staged changes into the repository history with a message. Example:  
  `git commit -m "Added new feature"`

- **git push**  
  Uploads commits from the local repository to a remote repository like GitHub so others can access your work.
